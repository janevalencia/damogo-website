# DamoGO Website

This project is a mock-up single landing page developed for a startup company running its business in educating and solving problem of food waste in SEA countries.

All assets used in this landing page is managed in [Hygraph](https://app.hygraph.com/3d9ca503cbd24a5e9f2c51780cc59825/master), a GraphQL powered Headless CMS (Content Management System).

The proposed technical solution and architecture of this project is based on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a React full-stack framework. This project is also integrated with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a CSS utility framework.
